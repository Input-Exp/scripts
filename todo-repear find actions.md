Need to dig next....:

2 years ago I printed this near 100 pages of stuff... a list of all (I guess) public interface properties.
(my best info is offline) or [on git](https://github.com/Jeff0S/sws) 


I dunno, weird parallels I had a mental moment with databases. 
I truly admire the customizability and interface, of reaper, especially the scripting and addons. 
Puzzled for years... 


Maybe interesting. Still kind of blurry...

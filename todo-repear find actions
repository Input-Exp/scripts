2 years ago I printed this near 100 pages of stuff... a list of all (I guess) public interface properties.



I dunno, weird parallels I had a mental moment with databases. 
I truly admire the customizability and interface, of reaper, especially the addons. Sharing to showoff, shit I'm not good enough to use yet.


Better for my flow, but it's still kind of blurry.
